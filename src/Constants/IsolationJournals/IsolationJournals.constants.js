      'I’ve always kept a journal. The bookcase in my childhood bedroom is filled with dozens of colorful notebooks, each one detailing a new chapter in my life. The pages read like conversations with myself, expressed in thick, swooping pen strokes: fever-dream visions for the future, lies about late-night adventures I never took but wished I had, thinly veiled autobiographical short stories driven by aspirational female protagonists, bad poetry, and lists, always lists—of dos, don’ts, and dreams.While stuck at home, I’ve been revisiting some of these entries and mostly chuckling and cringing at my younger self.Throughout, I’ve noticed a pattern—one that still applies to my writing practice: I tack a name at the top of the page, and think of what I’m writing as a kind of letter. (In one of my childhood diaries, I began each entry with “Dear Daddy Long Legs”—inspired by the spider I once tried to keep as a “pet, ” and the epistolary novel by Jean Webster).It’s often easier for me to start or to get unstuck when I conceive of writing as having an addressee at the other end.It helps me say what I want to say, and to fall into a more natural, conversational rhythm without overthinking.',

    prompt:
      'Write a letter to a stranger—someone imaginary, someone you met once, someone you only know from a distance. Tell them any and everything: when you first noticed them and what has happened since, how you’d like your day to start and to end, or what’s been on your mind. Or tell them a story about a time when something difficult led you to an unexpected, interesting, maybe even wondrous place. You may be stuck inside four walls, but there are no boundaries. Say whatever you want to say, whatever you think they need to hear.',

      'This morning, I’d like to introduce you to my dear friend, author and podcast host @noraborealis. We met last April in Vancouver during a very nerve-wracking week for me as I was scheduled to speak on the @ted main stage in a few days. When I bumped into her in the convention center hallway, I had just watched her talk and was so bowled over, crying and laughing and crying some more. Nora was not only incredibly nice—what they say about Midwesterners is true—but she helped me rehearse until my hands were steady. May this prompt offer you a similar sense of grounding, and may you, like Nora, search out humor in the hardest of times. BREAK  Nora McInerny How are you? A few weeks ago, no matter who asked, you’d have probably said “fine,” and then kept walking down the hall even if your world was fully falling apart on the inside.We’re all…not fine right now. We know that, right? Or, do we My podcast, Terrible, Thanks for Asking came from a rejected book title and from an aspirational response to the question we ask and answer a million times a year without even thinking about it. A question we ask without intention and answer with white lies even when we are at our husband’s funeral.An unnamed publisher (cough: HarperCollins) thought it was just too negative for a memoir about losing my husband to brain cancer.In my household, which now includes a blended family of four children and a second husband, the only f-word in our house is fine. If I ask how you are, or how your day was, you can say anything but fine. That does mean we’ve gotten some “feedback” from the Lutheran preschool about our toddler’s language. And it also means that we’re a little more emotionally honest with one another',
    prompt:
      'Put yourself in a moment where you were not fine. Maybe you were terrible, and maybe you were TOO GOOD TO BE TRUE. Put yourself back in that moment when you lied. Why did you do it? Whose feelings were you trying to save? Write what you wish you would have said, and imagine where that honest conversation could have led you.',

      "We are all going through collective culture shock right now. We are oh-so-quickly adjusting to a whole new way of going through the world: interpreting distance as kindness, embracing solitude for the sake of community, and advocating for stasis as a means of progress. It's wild and weird. This is a brand new land where none of us have ever been, even though most of us are at home. I've been thinking a lot about how this experience parallels to traveling to a new place, where cultural norms are totally different and our daily routines are out of whack and we have jet lag from lack of/too much sleep. We have to celebrate differently, mourn differently, even dress differently (i.e. incorporate masks and gloves into our outfits). Your prompt: Write a travel journal entry from your home, could be your living room, could be your bed. Write as though you've just arrived in a new place (because, in many ways, you have) and what you're observing about the place and how you feel in it. Write what you see, hear, and touch, as though it's all brand new. What are you learning about yourself in this different land, with all its deprivations? If you'd like to turn this into a visual entry, draw a map complete with notes about this foreign land's customs, rituals, and routines.",

      'Verified It’s Day Four of #TheIsolationJournals. I’m so pleased to introduce @jonbatiste, the musician, bandleader and music director for The Late Show with Stephen Colbert—who also moonlights as my beloved friend, partner & today’s prompt contributor. His topic is particularly fitting given that we first crossed paths as teenagers at band camp—perhaps the world’s nerdiest meeting place. Even then, in all of our awkward adolescent glory, he never failed to brighten a room. We’re trying something a little different today: In addition to a prompt, Jon has offered a little PSA & some musical inspiration for your writing. Full video at link in bio, or here: http://suleikajaouad.com/the-isolation-journals-prompts.♥️ Suleika. . DAY 04. - Jon Batiste As a human being on Planet Earth I’ve experienced my fair share of awkwardness. (Maybe more than most). I have learned to love these moments for in discomfort, valuable epiphanies are often found. Also, in retrospect, they can generate great laughter. Ah, the Glorious Awkwardness! Your prompt for today: Reflect on a particular moment in your past when you felt most in touch with your “Glorious Awkwardness.” It could be a cringe-worthy moment you’ve replayed a thousand times in your mind. Or something essential about who you are, something unchangeable. Go back there. What did you learn from it? Can you laugh about it? And if not, why?',

      'It’s Day Five.Today I’d like to introduce you to @lilybrooksdalton. I first learned of her around the same time I left home on a 15,000-mile solo road trip around the United States. She had just published a memoir, Motorcycles I’ve Loved, about her own adventures on the road, and she struck me as a kindred spirit right away. Since then, she’s become a dear friend and someone I can always depend on for sage advice and a fresh perspective on writing, on life, and on the sometimes absurd realities of modern love. Love,Suleika. . .DAY 05. - Lily Brooks-Dalton I’ve been thinking a lot about windows lately. I feel like we’re all on the same page about windows these days, especially those of us in cities. They’re tantalizing, nurturing, VITAL glimpses of that wondrous destination we are, depending on some extent to your locale, encouraged to avoid: the outdoors. Initially, it seemed like spending time alone in nature was maybe one thing we could do safely, but here in California, not-distant-at-all socializing ensued, which led to the closing of many of the gateways to LA’s outdoor spaces (beach parking lots, parks, trails, etc). So, in my little corner of Los Angeles at least, the collective gaze is laser-focused on these little panes of glass that separate us from the rest of the world.What is a window but a picture frame? And what is a picture frame but the borders of a moment? I watch my cat splayed across the windowsill in my apartment and I see a creature that has mastered this art of observation, of witnessing the world one rectangle at a time. I can’t help but think I have some lessons to learn in this arena...and ample time to learn them. Since looking out my windows with such round-the-clock care, I have never seen the view quite so clearly or completely..Your prompt for today: Find a good spot in front of your favorite window. What do you see? Write about the view—this can be a description of what’s unfolding right now, or you can branch off into a fictional reality. Maybe the window is open and sounds, smells, and a breeze are slipping in; maybe there are people in the street, maybe it’s empty. Either way, record the moment.',

      'Today we have a particularly extraordinary prompt from a particularly extraordinary guest. ♥️.DAY 06. - Lou Sullivan(with his mom @alexawilding) My six-year-old son, Lou is no stranger to quarantine. At one-year-old, he was diagnosed with a rare form of pediatric brain cancer. After four years in remission, Lou relapsed last spring and we spent much of last year cooped up in a hospital room, gloved, gowned and masked, so bored we were talking to the Purell dispensers. During the worst of it, when Lou could barely move and I couldn’t write a word, he came up with a game called ‘Inside Seeing’ that saved us both. . “Close your eyes,” he said, “and tell me what you see!” “Ugh, nothing?” “No, mama, really look. Inside!” We lay together in the hospital bed, closing our eyes until shapes and light flecks began to form behind our eyelids. “I see fireworks,” I said. “I see a monster,” Lou said, “but he’s actually nice.” After our journeying, Lou would draw what he saw, and I scribbled down ideas, amazed that my bald six-year-old was now my personal shaman and writing coach. “What’s it called when stars make pictures?” “Constellations?” I guessed. “Yes! I see constellations. The lines are a jungle gym, and we’re going to climb all the way back home.”.A few months later, we did make it home. Lou’s condition is finally stable. Last month he joined his twin brother, West, back at school, only to have COVID-19 force us back to a way of life we know all too well. We’ve been playing a lot of ‘Inside Seeing’ to pass the time, and Lou thinks you should try it, too..Today’s prompt (From Lou): Okay, close your eyes. Maybe lie down so you’re cozy? A blanket is nice. Okay. What do you see? At first, it’s dark in there. But if you really look, you will start to see pictures. Maybe it’s a bear with claws, or an ice cream cone, or a memory. Like, cuddling your mom. Maybe it’s words, like LOVE or DANCING. Sometimes it’s just tickly lights. Whatever you see, write about it. Really explain it until it becomes a story. I like to draw what I see, too.',

      'To round out our first week of #theisolationjournals, I’m honored and delighted to introduce my friend @rachel.cargle. Her explorations of race and womanhood have ignited meaningful conversations with people all over the world. In today’s prompt, however, she’s inviting us to have a dialogue with ourselves—past, present and future.♥️Suleika.DAY 07. - Rachel Cargle.Lately, I’ve found comfort in appreciating the various versions of myself thus far. That younger me who was brave enough to make the big move to the city. Child me who opened her heart to curiosity and found hobbies that I still indulge in today. Teenage me who was scared often and instead of pushing myself into discomfort I cared for myself with a confident "no" to things I preferred not to be a part of. That version of me just a few years ago who found little morsels of joy even in the midst of what felt like the biggest storm..I smile and look at her (those younger versions of me) with my mind’s eye. I hug her, I dance with her, I tell her I am proud of her, I forgive her for the things she was pitting against herself, I let her in on secrets about her future that she can only imagine..I also have been indulging in the practice of praying to future versions of myself. The version of myself next year who will be fresh off of surviving a global pandemic. The version of myself who is 40 and will be benefiting from the choices I am making now. The version of myself who is 50 and taking stock of how I have been existing in this world. The version of myself who is 70 who may be celebrating deeply in the friendships I am investing in now..I pray to those versions of me. I ask her to be gentle with me, I coax her for hints on what to come, I list for her all the ways I am caring for her, right now—with that expensive face cream, through weekly therapy, by taking a few risks in business. I make promises to her, I speak my desires for her. I get energized and inspired knowing that she—that sage and grounded version of me—is waiting to meet me finally..Take some time to reflect on all versions of yourself. This is a deeply intimate and revealing practice that can offer healing, insight, and hope',
